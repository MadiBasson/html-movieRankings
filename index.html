<h1>The Best Movies According to Madi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>I am a big horror fan and this one has always stuck with me. It is disturbing and dark and always comes to mind when I need to recommend scary movies to friends.</p>
<h3>The Upside</h3>
<p>I loved this movie. Kevin Heart acts in it but it is just a funny feel good movie. It makes you realise everyone is constantly working through something and that there is still always light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<h3>Brightburn</h3>
<p>Horror and soppy movies to a good super hero gone rogue movie. It's all me. This movie is so good, because I personally think it portrais what actually will happen should someone end up having superpowers. Leaving a scorched earth for us mortals. </p>
